# Host SQL Server

SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. It is a powerful database that is widely used in the industry.

!!! note "Non-free software"

    SQL Server is not open source and may have licensing restrictions. Please make sure you have the right to use SQL Server before hosting it on AnduinOS.
    
    Installing SQL Server on AnduinOS does not provide you with a license to use SQL Server. You must obtain a license from Microsoft to use SQL Server.

    Please read the [Microsoft SQL Server End-User Licensing Agreement‚Å†](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=857698) before using SQL Server.

To host SQL Server on AnduinOS, run the following commands.

First, make sure Docker is installed on your machine. If not, you can install Docker by running the following commands:

```bash title="Install Docker"
curl -fsSL get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
CHANNEL=stable sh get-docker.sh
rm get-docker.sh
```

Create a new folder to save the service configuration files:

```bash title="Prepare a clean directory"
# Please install Docker first
mkdir -p ~/Source/ServiceConfigs/SQLServer
cd ~/Source/ServiceConfigs/SQLServer
```

Make sure no other process is taking 1433 port on your machine.

```bash title="Check if the port is occupied"
function port_exist_check() {
  if [[ 0 -eq $(sudo lsof -i:"$1" | grep -i -c "listen") ]]; then
    echo "$1 is not in use"
    sleep 1
  else
    echo "Warning: $1 is occupied"
    sudo lsof -i:"$1"
    echo "Will kill the occupied process in 5s"
    sleep 5
    sudo lsof -i:"$1" | awk '{print $2}' | grep -v "PID" | sudo xargs kill -9
    echo "Killed the occupied process"
    sleep 1
  fi
}

port_exist_check 1433
```

Then, create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```bash title="Create a docker-compose.yml file"
cat << EOF > ./docker-compose.yml
version: '3.3' 

services:
  sqlserver:
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
    ports:
      - target: 1433
        published: 1433
        protocol: tcp
        mode: host
    environment:
      SA_PASSWORD: "YourStrong!Passw0rd"
      ACCEPT_EULA: "Y"
    volumes:
      - sqlserver-data:/var/opt/mssql

volumes:
  sqlserver-data:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: none
      o: bind
      device: /swarm-vol/sqlserver/data
EOF
sudo mkdir -p /swarm-vol/sqlserver/data
```

Then, deploy the service:

```bash title="Deploy the service"
sudo docker swarm init  --advertise-addr $(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')
sudo docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml sqlserver --detach
```

That's it! You have successfully hosted SQL Server on AnduinOS.

The default user is `sa` and the password is `YourStrong!Passw0rd`.

To manage your SQL Server, it is suggested to install Azure Data Studio. You can follow the instructions [here](../../Applications/Database-Tools/Azure-Data-Studio/Azure-Data-Studio.md).

## Uninstall

To uninstall SQL Server, run the following commands:

```bash title="Uninstall SQL Server"
sudo docker stack rm sqlserver
sleep 20 # Wait for the stack to be removed
sudo docker system prune -a --volumes -f # Clean up used volumes and images
```

To also remove the data, log, and config files, run the following commands:

```bash title="Remove the data, log, and config files"
sudo rm /swarm-vol/sqlserver -rf
```

That's it! You have successfully uninstalled SQL Server from AnduinOS.
