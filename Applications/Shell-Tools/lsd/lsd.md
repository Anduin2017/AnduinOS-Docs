# lsd

!!! tip "AnduinOS Verified App - Open Source"

    Lsd is an AnduinOS verified app and it runs awesome on AnduinOS, with easy installation and automatic updates.

lsd is the next gen ls command. [source code](https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd)

You must have [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) installed to ues lsd perfectly. But don't worry, the nerd fonts has already installed in AnduinOS by default. If your logo did't showup correctly in some ui, checkout your font settings.

Install lsd to AnduinOS:

```bash
sudo apt install lsd
```

Then you can set an alias to replace ls:

```bash
# write this line to your .bashrc or .zshrc etc
alias ls=lsd
```
