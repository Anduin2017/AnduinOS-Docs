    Fzf is an AnduinOS verified app and it runs awesome on AnduinOS, with easy installation and automatic updates.

It's an interactive filter program for any kind of list; files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc. It implements a "fuzzy" matching algorithm, so you can quickly type in patterns with omitted characters and still get the results you want.
