# eza (exa)

eza is a modern alternative to ls. [source code](https://github.com/eza-community/eza)

<!-- If you are still using exa, replace to eza bacause exa is nologger supported. -->

Install eza to AnduinOS:

```bash
sudo apt install eza
```

Then you can set an alias to replace ls:

```bash
# write this line to your .bashrc or .zshrc etc
alias ls=eza
```

`eza` package also provides `exa` command, so you can use `exa` as well.
