# ripgrep (rg)

ripgrep (rg) is an extremely fast alternative to `grep` that respects your gitignore. [source code](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

Run this command to install ripgrep on AnduinOS:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ripgrep
```

Then you can use `rg` to replace grep.

```bash
# add this line to your .bashrc or .zshrc
alias rg=grep
```
