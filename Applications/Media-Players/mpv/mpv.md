# mpv

mpv is a free and open-source media player software that is available for all major operating systems. It is a fork of mplayer2 and MPlayer. It shares some features with the former projects while introducing many more.

## Features

### Free and Open Source

mpv is a free (as in freedom) media player for the command line. It supports a wide variety of media file formats, audio and video codecs, and subtitle types.

### Scripting

Powerful scripting capabilities can make the player do almost anything. There is a large selection of user scripts on the [wiki](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#scripting).

### On Screen Controller

While mpv strives for minimalism and provides no real GUI, it has a small controller on top of the video for basic control.

### High Quality Video Output

mpv has an OpenGL, Vulkan, and D3D11 based video output that is capable of many features loved by videophiles, such as video scaling with popular high quality algorithms, color management, frame timing, interpolation, HDR, and more.

### GPU Video Decoding

mpv can leverage most hardware decoding APIs on all platforms. Hardware decoding can be enabled at runtime on demand.

### Embeddable

A straightforward C API was designed from the ground up to make mpv usable as a library and facilitate easy integration into other applications.

### Active Development

mpv is under active development, focusing on code refactoring and cleanups as well as adding features. Want a feature? Post a patch or request it!
