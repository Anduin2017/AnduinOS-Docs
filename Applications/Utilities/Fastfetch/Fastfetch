# Fastfetch

Fastfetch is a simple and fast system information tool written in C. Fastfetch shows information about your system, such as the operating system, kernel, uptime, packages, shell, and more. Fastfetch is inspired by neofetch, but it is much faster than neofetch.

To install Fastfetch, you can use the following commands:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:zhangsongcui3371/fastfetch
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fastfetch -y
```
