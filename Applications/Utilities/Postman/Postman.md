!!! warning "Unable to automatically upgrade this application"

    The above command only installs the launcher. If you run `sudo apt upgrade`, it won't upgrade it automatically. You will need to manually rerun the above command to upgrade.

    This is because the software provider didn't setup a repository for automatic updates. You will need to check the official website for updates.
