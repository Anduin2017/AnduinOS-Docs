# Steam

Steam is a digital distribution platform developed by Valve Corporation, which offers digital rights management (DRM), multiplayer gaming, video streaming and social networking services. Steam provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games on multiple computers, and community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud saving, and in-game voice and chat functionality. The software provides a freely available application programming interface (API) called Steamworks, which developers can use to integrate many of Steam's functions into their products, including networking, matchmaking, in-game achievements, micro-transactions, and support for user-created content through Steam Workshop.

To install Steam on AnduinOS, you can run:

```bash
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libc6-i386 libutempter0 xbitmaps xterm libgl1-mesa-dri:i386 libgl1:i386

wget https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/client/installer/steam.deb -O steam.deb
sudo dpkg -i steam.deb
sudo apt --fix-broken install -y
rm steam.deb
```

However, after installation, you will need to log in with your Steam account to download and play games. You can also install games from the Steam store using the Steam client.
