# Ollama

Ollama is a tool for getting up and running with Llama 3.3, DeepSeek-R1, Phi-4, Gemma 2, and other large language models.

To install Ollama, you can run the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

After installing Ollama, you may want to install some models like `DeepSeek`.

To install DeepSeek, you can run the following command:

ollama run deepseek-r1:7b
```

That's it! You're now ready to use Ollama and its models.

You may also want to deploy a web UI for Ollama. To do this, you can deploy the [https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui](Open WebUI) project.
